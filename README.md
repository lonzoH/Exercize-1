Create a Processing "sketch" with randomly moving graphics using random, probability and Perlin Noise

The sketch must:

utilizes custom classes
has animated or moving graphics
utilizes random
uses probabilty
uses another random principle discussed in the text (Monte Carlo, Perlin Noise, Levy Flights, etc)
Create an agent class that using Processing. Remember that in Artificial Intelligence, an agent is a unit that has the ability to move and perceive the environment. Use this exercise to build your agent and to explore Processing. After reading NoC's Introduction, utilize the principles with random and concepts related to it: probability, different distributions, Perlin Noise, etc. This could be used for animations or the creation of graphics.
